Implemented additional diagnostics to calculate export fluxes of PON, 
POC, BSi and Calc at some depth

- introduced new compiler option RECOM_EXPORT_DIAGNOSTICS (in RECOM_OPTIONS.h)
  to switch on/off the export flux diagnostics
- Increased the number of 2-dimensional recom diagnostics NDiagsRecom2D 
  by four in RECOM.h to accomodate the fluxes, when the switch is set.
- implemented one additonal 2-d output field export(i,j) in
  recom_sinking.F, that contains the calculated fluxes at the upper
  boundary of layer KEXP. At the moment KEXP is hardcoded to 7 (CHANGE 
  this at some point!)
- took care that the additional output field of recom_sinking is also
  defined in the calling routine recom_sms.F, and that the contents is
  then added to the 2-d diagnostics diags2d(i,j,n). n=10 stands for 
  flux of particulate nitrogen (PhyN+DiaN+DetN), n=11 for particulate
  organic carbon (PhyC+DiaC+DetC), n=12 for calcite (PhyCalc+DetCalc)
  and n=13 for opal (DiaSi+DetSi).
- The 2-D diagnistics are then transferred to the new diagnostic fields
  'EXPORTN ', 'EXPORTC ', 'EXPCALC ' and 'EXPORTSI' in recom_forcing.F
- these new export fields are defined in recom_diagnostics_init.F

recom_forcing.F, recom_diagnostics_init.F)

in recom_forcing.F the diagnostic DIAFFE was filled with
recom_diag_2Dfields(i,j,8) instead of recom_diag_2Dfields(i,j,9). So, 
effectively the diagnostic contained the diagenetic silica flux, 
not the iron flux

impemented a new option RECOM_FE_RECYCLING_SHORT in RECOM_OPTIONS.h;
if set, this option causes that all processes that lead to the production 
of DOC directly increase dissolved iron, instead of releasing
dissolved iron from organic matter when DOC is respired. Effectively
this means that all organic species of iron are directly bioavailable. 

(affected: RECOM_OPTIONS.h, recom_sms.F)

Bug correction, september 2012, Tingting Wang

in the present version or REcoM, iron is released in dissolved form 
whenever organic carbon is respired to inorganic carbon. This implicitly
assumes that iron in dissolved organic carbon is *NOT* bioavailable. 
While this is a possible way of description, it needs at least to be done
consistently. In recom_sms.F, however, there was one inconsistency: The
release of organic carbon from zooplankton was also counted as a release
of dissolved iron. This led to the same iron being remineralized twice:
when zooplankkton excrete DOC and then again, when this DOC is respired. 

This was corrected by removing one line of code in recom_sms.F, where
sms(....,ife) was increased by lossC_z * hetC

Bug correction, July 2012, Christoph Voelker

Sebastian Sonntag has pointed me to a bug in recom_insolation.F that
concerns the calculation of the incident angle of light under water.

The angle is derived from Snellius' law which states that

sin(phi1) / sin(phi2) = n

where phi1 is the angle of the direction of the light with the
vertical in the atmosphere, phi2 is the same angle under water, and n
is the refraction index of the medium, for water roughly 1.33.

from Snellius' law we can follow:

sin(phi2)^2 = sin(phi1)^2 / n^2

so that (using cos^2 = 1 - sin^2):

cos(phi2)^2 = (1 - sin(phi2)^2) = (1 - sin(phi1)^2 / n^2 )
   = (1 - (1 - cos(phi1)^2) / n^2 )

This would mean that in the code we should have

cosAngleOfIncidence(i,j) = SQRT( 1.
     &       - (1. - cosAngleNoon(i,j)**2)/nWater**2 )

but instead we had

cosAngleOfIncidence(i,j) = SQRT( 1.
     &       - ( (1. - cosAngleNoon(i,j)**2)/nWater )**2 )

The additional brackets cause that instead of sin(phi1)^2 we
calculated sin(phi1)^4. The difference vanishes for vertical (phi1=0)
and horizontal (phi1=90) incidence, but generally our calculated angle
is somewhat lower than it should be, i.e. we underestimated the angle
in the water, or, which is equivalent, overestimated the penetration of
light into the the water (the lower the angle, the deeper does light
penetrate).
This was changed.

Correction of three bugs in treating the sediment: 

- when organic nitrogen from the sediment is converted to dissolved
  inorganic nitrogen in the lowermost model box (done on recom_sms.F),
  alkalinity should also be changed (corresponding to the transfer
  from DON to DIN). This had been forgotten. Also, when POC is
  remineralized, this should not only be a source of DIC, but also of
  dissolved Fe. 
- The units of the sediment diagnostic variables NBENTHOS, CBENTHOS,
  SBENTHOS and CALCBENT that was defined in recom_diagnostics_init.F
  was set wrong: These variables are concentrations (unit mmol/m^3),
  not vertically integrated concentrations (mmol/m^2). 
- I had forgotten to write/read the sediment CaCO3 concentration field
  into/from the recom-pickup files. This is now added (but only if
  RECOM_CALCIFICATION is defined)

If RECOM_ATMOSPCO2_HISTORY is set, the atmospheric pCO2 field is now
set to a spatially uniform value that is interpolated in time from the
(typically annual) time-series CO2ATM that has been initialised in 
recom_init_fixed.F. Also, a new namelist is defined in data.recom,
namely RECOM_ATMOSPCO2

replaced calls to MDSWRITEFIELD by calls to WRITE_REC_3D_RL; the former is
outdated, it still exists, but only writes out an error message. I checked
how to replace it by copying how it is done in land/land_write_pickup.F

(affected: recom_checkpoint.F)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
June 11, 2011, Christoph Voelker

defined a new define switch: RECOM_ATMOSPCO2_HISTORY. If this is set, the 
model initially reads in a file of annual atmospheric pCO2 and then adapts
the atmospheric pCO2 following how it is done in the DIC package if dic_int2=2.
At present this is not complete; missing is the time interpolation. 

(affected so far: RECOM_OPTIONS.h, RECOM.h, RECOM_PARAMS.h, recom_readparms.F, 
recom_init_fixed.F)

Removed a small bug in recom_external_fields_load.F: The time interpolation 
for dust deposition was done in such a way that only the last dust deposition 
mattered: instead of 
            feDustDeposit(i,j,bi,bj) = bWght*feDustDeposit0(i,j,bi,bj)
     &                                +aWght*feDustDeposit1(i,j,bi,bj)
there was
            feDustDeposit(i,j,bi,bj) = bWght*feDustDeposit0(i,j,bi,bj)
     &                                +aWght*feDustDeposit0(i,j,bi,bj)

Also added initialisation of recombenthicCaCO3 in recom_init_vari.F

Added Tingtings code for a direct loss of heterotrophs to dissolved organic
matter ('peeing'). This introduces new parameters lossC_z and lossN_z into
data.recom
Also added Tingtings more consequent differentiation between the sinking of 
small phytoplankton and of diatoms (Vdia)

(affected: recom_sms.F, recom_readparms.F, RECOM_PARAMS.h)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
May 23, 2011, Christoph Voelker

added one new diagnostic, 'HPlus   ' in recom_diagnostics_init.F and 
took care that the corresponding diagnostic is filled in recom_forcing.F

(affected: recom_diagnostics_init.F, recom_forcing.F)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

corrected two bugs in recom_sms.F found by Tingting: 
quantities relatid to silica uptake by diatoms were calculated
with parameters for the small phytoplankton group.

Changes I have made to bring REcoM2 up-to-date with
MITgcm, version 62r:

1) recom_forcing.F: The array AREA used to be 5-dimensional. Since
version 61r the vertical dimension is gone and it is
4-dimensional.

2) recom_init_vari.F and recom_external_fields_load.F: references
to the old macros (defined in CPP_EEMACROS.h) _EXCH_XY_R4 have been
replaced by _EXCH_XY_RS

3) recom_insolation.F: Since version 62o the old flag useSphereF=.true.
has been replaced by selectCoriMap=2. So I replaced 
'if ( .not. useSphereF )' by 'if ( selectCoriMap .LT. 2 )'

4) the subroutine diagnostics_add2list was renamed to
diagnostics_addtolist in version 62d. All calls were replaced in
recom_diagnostics.F 

5) in do_fields_blocking_exchanges.F gibt es einen Aufruf von
ptracers_fields_blocking_exchanges; der code dafuer war irgendwie
nicht da. Hab ich von Martins aktueller REcoM(1)-Version genommen.

This is a list of bugs/errors/open issues and other things that could
be better in REcoM2. As something is repaired it will be marked in
this list as solved

- carbonate equilibrium: Alkalinity does not include the contribution
  from Silicate yet

- carbonate equilibrium: if pH goes outside the predefined maximum and
  minimum for the root-finding routine it does strange
  things. Tingting has coded a fix, but I am not sure it works
  correctly under all circumstances

- pCO2 in the atmosphere cannot yet be calculated interactively

- recom_sms: should phytoplankton respiration perhaps depend on
  temperature?
